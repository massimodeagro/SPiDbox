# Install the software

This readme will guide you in the process of installing the software onto your raspberry Pi. Before starting, be sure to have:
* Your Raspberry Pi zero, that will drive the SPiDbox
  if your Raspberry Pi zero does not have a wifi receiver (not the W version), you will also need a Raspberry Pi 3B for the installation process
* A usb mouse
* A usb keyboard
* A wifi internet connection
* A micro-sd card
* A computer thatcan read micro-sd cards

## Install Raspbian

The first step to install the SPiDbox is to install the raspberry Pi OS. You will need a micro sd card. The minimum workable size is 8gb,but the bigger it is the longer you can work with it before needing to empty the card from the videos.

1. connect the SD card to your computer and download the raspbian OS https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/. The SPiDbox can work with the "Lite" version of Raspbian. Be aware however that this version has no desktop, so if you don't feel confident with working only with the command line, download the "desktop" version.
2. Connect the SD card, Download and install on your computer etcher https://www.balena.io/etcher/. Launch the software and follow instruction to flash the Raspbian os onto the SD card. **This process will wipe any contnent on your sd-card, so be sure there are no important files inside and that you are selecting the right device**
