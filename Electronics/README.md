# Soldering the circuit

On the pdf you will be able to see the connections that needs to be made. A printed circuit is in the making, but for now connections will need to be made by hand.

The circuit is fundamentally pretty simple, the board will have the job of connecting the raspberry with the other components.

I suggest you start by soldering a 20x2 connectors to a board. This connector will link to a ribbon cable, that will on the other side connect to the Raspberry Pi. Then, follow the schematic to connect the rest of the components.
