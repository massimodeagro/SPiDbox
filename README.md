# SPiDbox
## A Skinnerbox system to train jumping SPiDers based on the Raspberry Pi

### Before we start
A full description of the SPiDbox, as well as the experimental validation, is published in the Journal of Neuroscience methods (LINK)

### This GitHub page contains:
* In the "3D_models" folder, the .scad files of all the components to 3d print
* In the "OS" folder, the full python script, that will have to be copied in the home folder of the Raspberry Pi (see the installation guide)
* In the "Electronics" folder, a pdf depicting how the circuit needs to be built
* The "screenImages" folder is part of a work in progress. For now it only needs to be copied inside the home folder of the Raspberry Pi

Inside each folder you will find a guide for printing, installation and building, respectively.

For any request or comment, please contact me at *massimo.deagro@gmail.com*. I would like to make the guides as user-friendly as possible, so every suggestion is highly appreciated.
