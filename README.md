# SPiDbox: a Skinnerbox system to train jumping SPiDers based on the Raspberry Pi

## Before we start
A full description of the SPiDbox, as well as the experimental validation, is available in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2020.108925). if you use the system, please cite the paper.

## This GitHub page contains:
* In the "3D_models" folder, the .scad files of all the components to 3d print
* In the "OS" folder, the full python script, that will have to be copied in the home folder of the Raspberry Pi (see the installation guide)
* In the "Electronics" folder, a pdf depicting how the circuit needs to be built
* The "screenImages" folder is part of a work in progress. For now, it only needs to be copied inside the home folder of the Raspberry Pi

**Inside each folder you will find a guide for printing, installation and building, respectively.**

For any request or comment, please contact me at *massimo.de-agro@ur.de*. I would like to make the guides as user-friendly as possible, so every suggestion is highly appreciated.
